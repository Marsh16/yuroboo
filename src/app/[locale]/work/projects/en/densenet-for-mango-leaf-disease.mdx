## Overview

Mango plants (Mangifera indica) are a significant export commodity in the horticultural industry, offering numerous nutritional and economic benefits. They are rich in essential micronutrients, vitamins, and phytochemicals, contributing to their high demand globally. However, mango plants are susceptible to various diseases that can severely impact their yield and quality. These diseases pose a challenge to mango farmers, many of whom struggle to identify and treat them effectively, leading to potential harvest failures. This study aims to address this challenge by implementing a Deep Learning approach to classify diseases in mango leaves. Specifically, the research utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with DenseNet architecture, known for its efficiency in image classification tasks. The study incorporates Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image preprocessing to enhance detail and improve the model’s performance. Transfer Learning is utilized to optimize the DenseNet model, leveraging a pre-trained model to achieve high accuracy even with a relatively small dataset. The dataset used in this research comprises 4000 labeled images of mango leaves, covering seven disease categories and healthy leaves. These images include common diseases such as Anthracnose, Dieback, Powdery Mildew, Red Rust, Cutting Weevil, Bacterial Canker, and Sooty Mould. The DenseNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.5% in classifying mango leaf diseases.

## Methods Used
Data Collection: 
- **Mendeley Data**: This  study  includes  a  dataset  of  4000  images  of  mango  leaves, each labeled according to the type of disease or health condition. The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of images—500  for  each  category.  The  categories  include  Anthracnose,  Powdery  Mildew,  Bacterial  Canker,  Cutting  Weevil,  Die  Back,  Gall  Midge,  Sooty  Mold,  and  Healthy.

Data Pre-Processing: 
- **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**: The use of CLAHE for image preprocessing significantly enhanced  the  detail  in  the  images,  making  it  easier  for  the  model   to   identify   disease   features.
- **Data Augmentation Techniques**: Data   augmentation   techniques, that  are  used  in  this  study  (random rotation, vertical  and  horizontal  flipping),  increased  the  diversity  of  the dataset, improving the model’s robustness and accuracy.
- **Image Normalization**: the CNN model can more effectively identify important features. This is essential because   it   ensures   that   the   model   can   process   images   consistently.

Model Selection: 
- **DenseNet121**: In this Deep Learning classification model, the architecture used in classifying diseases in mango leaf is DenseNet121.

Model Training:
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer is  used  in  this  research  to  optimize  model  performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Transfer  learning  played  a  vital  role  in  optimizing  the  DenseNet model’s performance. By leveraging a pre-trained model, the study was able to achieve high accuracy even with a  relatively  small  dataset.

Model Evaluation:
- **Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Model  Loss  and  Accuracy Graphs**

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Using Python for the programming languange 
- **Tensorflow**: Using Tensorflow Library and Keras API

## Challenges and Learnings

While the DenseNet model achieved high accuracy, there are  areas  for  improvement.  Future  research  could  focus  on  expanding  the  dataset  to  include  more  images  and  different  disease  categories  to  improve  the  model’s  robustness  and  generalizability.  Implementing  other  advanced  techniques,  such  as  ensemble  learning,  could  also  be  explored  to  boost  classification accuracy.

## Outcome

The DenseNet model using CLAHE demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying mango leaf diseases, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.5%. This high level of accuracy indicates the model’s effectiveness in distinguishing between different disease categories and healthy leaves.
