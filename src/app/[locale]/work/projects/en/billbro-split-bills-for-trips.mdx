## Overview

BillBro for Macro Challenge at Apple Developer Academy @ UC, is an application that can help a group of people who are traveling on vacation together to split bills for their activities in more detail, so that several bills can be divided in 1 application and not fragmented, and they can get their invoices more completely and more reliable calculations with manual input features or scanned notes by utilizing OCR (Optical character recognition). OCR is a system used to convert text or images into digital text. The features in this application can help users more easily divide their bills when traveling on vacation together. 

## Key Features

- **Scan and Convert Bills**: Scan your bill and auto-generate the details.
- **Split Expenses Fairly**: Assign Bills with fair share calculations. 
- **Track All Your Expenses**: Keep all your bills in one place and see who owes you what.
- **Share Debt Summary**: Instantly send the expense breakdown to your group. 

## Technologies Used

- **OCR Scan**: Using OCR to Input bill by taking picture/choosing picture of receipt. Using an Gemini AI API from a Third Party
- **Widget**: Faster Access to Insert Bills. Using SwiftUI and SwiftData
- **Notification**: Trip Manager get Notification after trip end H+1 and H+3 to remind their participants. OneSignal (service to send push notifications) a Third Party, Supabase for online database so, it can be integrated with onesignal to send push notification.
- **Active Trips**: BillBro have active trips so user can choose their trip faster in widget. Using SwiftUI and Swift.
- **Share PDF**: Sharing trip in PDF Invoice File to your participants or save the pdf file. Using SwiftUI and PDFKit.
- **Copy Account Number**: Copy the number and transfer. Using SwiftUI.
- **Database**: SwiftData and Supabase (only for notification)

## Tech Stack

- **Apple Techs**: SwiftUI, SwiftData, WidgetKit, Notifications, PDFKit
- **Third Party**: OneSignal, Gemini API, Supabase

## Challenges and Learnings

The current Git merging process lacks thoroughness, often leading to the inclusion of outdated or duplicate code. To mitigate this, the team will emphasize a more careful selection of code changes during the merging process. Furthermore, the current error handling approach, relying heavily on the "!" operator, poses a significant risk of app crashes. Moving forward, the team plans to implement more robust error handling mechanisms like guard, if let, and try-catch blocks. Additionally, the team recognizes the potential benefits of adopting the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to enhance code maintainability, testability, and overall project structure.

## Outcome

BillBro successfully addresses the challenges of splitting expenses among friends during group travel. By leveraging advanced technologies like OCR, AI-powered Gemini API, and cloud-based services, the application offers a user-friendly and efficient solution.

This project demonstrates a successful application of cutting-edge technologies to solve a real-world problem, showcasing the potential of innovative solutions to improve travel experiences and enhance social interactions.
