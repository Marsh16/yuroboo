## Overview

Smoking and drinking are major health concerns globally, leading to various diseases like cancer, lung disease, and liver disease. Early identification of these habits is crucial for preventative measures. The HealthSignal application is designed to address this challenge by leveraging machine learning to predict smoking and drinking habits based on body signal data collected from users.

## How it Works

HealthSignal is an Android mobile application that utilizes machine learning models to analyze body signal data and predict a user's likelihood of being a smoker or drinker. The application employs two primary machine learning models:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: This model is highly effective for identifying drinkers based on body signal patterns.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier**: This model, also known as a Neural Network Classifier, excels at recognizing smokers from body signal data.

Both models are optimized using Grid-Search or Random-Search hyperparameter tuning to ensure maximum accuracy.

## Benefits

HealthSignal offers several benefits for users and healthcare professionals:
- **Early Detection**: The application can potentially aid in the early identification of smoking and drinking habits, allowing for timely interventions and preventative measures.
- **Improved Healthcare Management**: By predicting these habits, healthcare providers can gain valuable insights into a patient's health risks, enabling them to develop more personalized treatment plans.
- **User Awareness**: The application can empower users to gain insights into their health and make informed decisions regarding smoking and drinking habits.

## Tech Stack

The HealthSignal application is built using the following technologies:
- **Android Studio**: The primary development platform for the mobile application.
- **TensorFlow Lite (TFlite)**: A machine learning framework that enables deploying machine learning models on Android devices.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers are used for prediction.
- **Python**: Using Python for the programming languange 

## Outcome

The HealthSignal application presents a promising approach to leveraging machine learning for predicting smoking and drinking habits based on body signal data. By offering early detection and promoting user awareness, HealthSignal has the potential to improve preventative healthcare measures and empower individuals to make informed choices regarding their health.
